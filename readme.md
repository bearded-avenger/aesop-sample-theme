# Description

This is an extremely basic sample WordPress theme showing how to implement Aesop Story Engine. It's a near direct port of the same theme used on the [Demo](http://playground.aesopstories.com). The theme is written in LESS and compiled with Grunt. If you don't know what these things are, then just edit the style.css as needed. To uncompress the css file use this site [http://refresh-sf.com/yui/](http://refresh-sf.com/yui/)  

[Aesop Story Engine](http://aesopstories.com/story-engine) is an open-sourced suite of tools that empowers developers to build feature-rich, interactive, long-form storytelling themes for Wordpress.  

This sample theme ONLY includes styling for the single story page.
